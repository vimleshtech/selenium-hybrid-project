Page Object Model (POM) & Page Factory
=============================================================
For each webage in the application we will create seperate class
Advantages
	- Page Object Pattern says operation and flows in the UI should be separated from verification(test case)
	- Object repository is independent 
	- Code becomes less and optimized because of the reusable page method
